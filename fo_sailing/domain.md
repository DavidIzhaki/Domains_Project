# ‚õµ FO Sailing Problem Domain (PDDL)

The **FO Sailing Problem Domain** is an extended version of the classical Sailing domain. It models a scenario where boats navigate a 2D grid to save people while managing their speed and direction. This extension introduces **first-order control** over acceleration and deceleration, allowing boats to move more or less in a single action. The domain is designed to test **linear numeric planning** and **effect abstraction**.

This domain is particularly useful for testing:
- **First-order numeric control** (e.g., acceleration and deceleration)
- **Linear numeric planning**
- **Path optimization with velocity constraints**

## üìÇ Domain Overview

### Objects

- **Boats**: Represent vessels that navigate the grid to save people.
- **Persons**: Represent individuals who need to be rescued.

---

## üßÆ Domain Type: Linear Numeric Planning (LNP)

This domain includes:

**Preconditions** with **linear expressions** involving multiple fluents and constants:
```lisp
(>= (+ (x ?b) (y ?b)) (d ?t))
(>= (- (y ?b) (x ?b)) (d ?t))
(<= (+ (x ?b) (y ?b)) (+ (d ?t) 25))
(<= (- (y ?b) (x ?b)) (+ (d ?t) 25))
(<= (v ?b) 1)
```

**Effects** include **linear updates**, where variables are multiplied by fluents:
```lisp
(decrease (y ?b) (* (v ?b) 2))
(decrease (x ?b) (* (v ?b) 3))
```

**Goals** are purely propositional:
```lisp
(saved p0)
```

Since both **preconditions and effects** include **linear expressions**, and **goals are propositional**, this domain is classified as **LNP (Linear Numeric Planning)**.

  </pre>

#### Description:

Rescues a person when the boat is within a specific area defined by coordinate constraints and is moving slowly enough (velocity ‚â§ 1).

## üîç What the Planner Tries to Do

The planner must:

- Navigate boats across a 2D coordinate system.
- Manage velocity using acceleration and deceleration actions.
- Satisfy coordinate-based constraints to rescue people.
- Optimize paths to minimize the number of actions required.

---

## üßæ Example

Suppose:

- Boat b1 starts at coordinates (0,0) with velocity v(b1) = 1.
- Person p1 needs to be rescued with d(p1) = 10.

**Initial state:**

- x(b1) = 0, y(b1) = 0, v(b1) = 1.
- p1 is not saved.

**Goal:**

- p1 is saved.

The planner might decide:

1. Use accelerate (b1) to increase velocity to 2.
2. Use go_north_east (b1) twice to reach (6,6).
3. Use decelerate (b1) to reduce velocity to 1.
4. Use save_person (b1, p1) since (6+6) ‚â• 10 and other constraints are satisfied.

## üß™ Example Use Cases

- Maritime search and rescue operations.
- Velocity and direction control in navigation.
- Testing planners' ability to handle first-order numeric effects.
- Evaluating path optimization with velocity constraints.
