# Zenotravel Domain - Fuel Optimization

## Overview
The **Zenotravel domain** models a transportation system where **people board aircraft, travel between cities, and consume fuel**.  
The original domain was introduced in **IPC-2002** and has been adapted for better efficiency in fuel consumption.

## Key Issue: Linear Metric Problems
- The **original domain structure** creates **linear metric inconsistencies** that can cause **suboptimal or infeasible plans**.
- To **mitigate this issue**, the focus is on **fuel consumption adjustments**.

## Fuel Mechanics
Fuel is a critical resource, and **aircraft consume fuel based on their travel speed**.  
Each aircraft has:
- **`fuel(?a - aircraft)`** → Current fuel level.
- **`capacity(?a - aircraft)`** → Maximum fuel capacity.
- **`total-fuel-used`** → Tracks overall fuel consumption.
- **`slow-burn(?a - aircraft)`** → Fuel burned per distance unit in slow travel.
- **`fast-burn(?a - aircraft)`** → Fuel burned per distance unit in fast travel.

## Optimization Strategy
### 1. Ensuring **Fast Travel is More Efficient**
To achieve **better domain performance**, **`fast-burn` must be lower than `slow-burn`**, meaning:
**fast-burn(a) < slow-burn(a)**
This ensures:
- **Fast travel is preferable** when fuel efficiency is required.
- The planner will **choose the right travel mode** based on constraints.

### 2. Fuel Consumption Adjustments
#### **Refueling (`refuel`)**
- Restores aircraft fuel to full capacity.

#### **Flight Actions**
- **Fly-Slow (`fly-slow`)**:  
  - Uses **`slow-burn`** to determine fuel usage.
  - Moves an aircraft while consuming more fuel.
  
- **Fly-Fast (`fly-fast`)**:  
  - Uses **`fast-burn`** (which must be **lower than `slow-burn`**).
  - **Zoom-limit** restricts fast travel to a limited number of passengers.

 ## 🧮 Domain Type: Linear Task (LT) This domain models fuel consumption and movement in air travel using **numeric fluents** and **linear arithmetic expressions**. 
 It qualifies as a **Linear Task (LT)** due to the following characteristics: 
 - ✅ Uses **numeric fluents** such as `fuel`, `onboard`, and `fuel-used` 
 - ✅ Includes **linear preconditions** involving static functions like `distance` and `burn rate`, e.g., `(>= (fuel ?a) (* (slow-burn ?a) (distance ?c1 ?c2)))` 
 - ✅ Numeric effects use `increase` and `decrease` with **linear expressions** based on static terms (e.g., `(increase (fuel-used) (* (slow-burn ?a) (distance ?c1 ?c2)))`) 
 - ❌ Does **not** use assignments (`:=`) or non-linear expressions 
 - ❌ Violates **SNT** constraints because the `increase`/`decrease` operations are **not by constant literals**, but by computed static terms involving parameters This makes the domain a clear **Linear Task (LT)** 
 — expressive enough for real-world modeling while still compatible with many numeric planners that support linear arithmetic. 

## Summary
This adaptation of **Zenotravel** improves **fuel efficiency** by ensuring that:
- **`fast-burn` is always lower than `slow-burn`** for optimal planning.
- The planner **prefers fuel-efficient routes** while maintaining constraints.
- Refueling, boarding, and debarking remain **unaffected** but support **better energy management**.

By making **fast travel more fuel-efficient**, the domain now produces **more optimal plans** and resolves **metric inconsistencies**.
