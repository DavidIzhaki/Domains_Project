# üöó RedCar Domain (PDDL)

The **RedCar Domain** is a grid-based planning domain inspired by the classic Rush Hour puzzle. In this domain, vehicles (cars and trucks) are placed on a 6√ó6 grid and must be moved according to specific movement rules until the red car reaches an exit position. This domain is designed for evaluating numeric planners and heuristic search methods in grid-based scenarios.

## üìÇ Domain Overview

### Objects

- **Vehicles:**
  - **Horizontal Cars** (`horizontalCar`): Represent vehicles that can move left or right and typically occupy 2 consecutive grid cells.
  - **Vertical Cars** (`verticalCar`): Represent vehicles that can move up or down and also typically occupy 2 consecutive cells.
  - **Horizontal Trucks** (`horizontalTruck`): Represent trucks that move laterally over 3 consecutive cells.
  - **Vertical Trucks** (`verticalTruck`): Represent trucks that move vertically over 3 consecutive cells.

- **Positions:**
  - Individual grid cells are modeled as objects (e.g., `p0`, `p1`, ..., `p5`).
  - Each cell is mapped to numeric coordinates by the functions:
    - `(pos-cell-x ?p)` and `(pos-cell-y ?p)`

##  Domain Type: Restricted Numeric Planning (RNP)

This domain includes:

**Preconditions** that are:
- **Single-variable numeric constraints**, where only `?c` is a fluent variable and the rest are constants:
```lisp
(<= (pos-cell-y ?y2) (max_y))                 ;; Ensure grid bounds
(= (pos-cell-x ?x) (pos-x ?c))                ;; X stays constant
(= (pos-cell-y ?y) (pos-y ?c))                ;; current Y
(= (pos-cell-y ?y2) (+ (pos-y ?c) 2))         ;; target Y
```

**Effects** are **constant updates** to fluents:
```lisp
(increase (pos-x ?t) 1)
(increase (total-cost) 1)
```

**Goals** are simple numeric conditions:
```lisp
(:goal (and 
    (= (pos-x red-car) 4)  
    (= (pos-y red-car) 2)
))
```

Since preconditions involve **a single variable with constants**, effects are **constant**, and goals are **simple**, this domain is classified as **RNP (Restricted Numeric Planning)**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Domain Mechanics

### Functions & Fluents

- **Vehicle Position Functions:**
  - `(pos-x ?v - vehicle)`: Returns the X coordinate of a vehicle.
  - `(pos-y ?v - vehicle)`: Returns the Y coordinate of a vehicle.

- **Grid Boundary Functions:**
  - `(min_x)`, `(max_x)`, `(min_y)`, `(max_y)`: Define the grid's numerical limits.

- **Cell Mapping Functions:**
  - `(pos-cell-x ?p - position)`: Maps a cell object to its numeric X coordinate.
  - `(pos-cell-y ?p - position)`: Maps a cell object to its numeric Y coordinate.

- **Cost Tracking:**
  - `(total-cost)`: A numeric fluent that accumulates the movement cost.

### Predicates

- **Cell Occupancy:**
  - `(clear ?p1 ?p2 - position)`: A Boolean predicate indicating whether a grid cell is free. By default, a cell is false (occupied) unless explicitly declared clear in the `:init` section.

### Truck Actions

For trucks (which typically span 3 consecutive cells), the actions are analogous but operate on groups of cells. For example:

#### ‚ûï `move-truck-right`
<pre>
(:action move-truck-right
  :parameters (?t - horizontalTruck ?newCell - position ?row - position)
  :precondition (and
    ; The new cell at the truck‚Äôs right extreme must be within grid bounds

    (= (pos-cell-y ?row) (pos-y ?t))
    ; The target cell is clear
    (clear ?newCell ?row)
  )
  :effect (and
    ; Free the leftmost cell the truck previously occupied
    (clear (pos-x ?t) (pos-y ?t))
    ; Mark the new rightmost cell as occupied
    (not (clear ?newCell ?row))
    ; Increase the truck's x-coordinate by 1
    (increase (pos-x ?t) 1)
    (increase (total-cost) 1)
  )
)
</pre>

    ; The target row must match the truck's current row
    (= (pos-cell-y ?row) (pos-y ?t))
    ; The new left cell is clear
    (clear ?newCell ?row)
  )
  :effect (and
    ; Free the rightmost cell of the truck
    (clear (pos-x ?t) (pos-y ?t))
    ; Mark the new left cell as occupied
    (not (clear ?newCell ?row))
    ; Decrease the truck's x-coordinate by 1
    (decrease (pos-x ?t) 1)
    (increase (total-cost) 1)
  )
)
</pre>

#### ‚¨Ü `move-truck-up`
<pre>

    (decrease (pos-y ?t) 1)
    (increase (total-cost) 1)
  )
)
</pre>

#### ‚¨á `move-truck-down`
<pre>
(:action move-truck-down
  :parameters (?t - verticalTruck ?newCell - position ?col - position)
  :precondition (and
    ; The new cell at the truck's bottom extreme must be within grid bounds
    (< (pos-cell-y ?newCell) (max_y))
    ; The target column must match the truck's current column

## üîç What the Planner Tries to Do

In each case, the planner is required to:
- Verify that the target cell or group of cells is within grid boundaries.
- Ensure that the target cell(s) is clear.
- Move the vehicle by updating its numeric positions (via an increase or decrease).
- Update the overall cost (using a constant increment).

The planner's task is to chain together a sequence of such actions until the goal state is reached (typically, the red car reaches the exit).

---

## üéí Extras

This domain type is classified as a **Simple Numeric Task (SNT)** because:
- The only arithmetic performed in preconditions and effects is constant addition or subtraction.
- No complex linear combinations of numeric fluents are used.
- The domain is both efficient and straightforward for numeric planners to handle.

Alternate classifications:
- **Restricted Linear (RL)** or **Linear Task (LT)** would apply if more complex arithmetic or linear constraints were involved.
- In this domain, however, the operations are simple enough to be classified as **SNT**.
